   abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across a wide variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and have attracted attention from multiple domains, including financial services. Despite the extensive research into general-domain LLMs, and their immense potential in finance, Financial LLM (FinLLM) research remains limited. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of FinLLMs, including their history, techniques, performance, and opportunities and challenges. Firstly, we present a chronological overview of general-domain Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) through to current FinLLMs, including the GPT-series, selected open-source LLMs, and financial LMs. Secondly, we compare five techniques used across financial PLMs and FinLLMs, including training methods, training data, and fine-tuning methods. Thirdly, we summarize the performance evaluations of six benchmark tasks and datasets. In addition, we provide eight advanced financial NLP tasks and datasets for developing more sophisticated FinLLMs. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and the challenges facing FinLLMs, such as hallucination, privacy, and efficiency. To support AI research in finance, we compile a collection of accessible datasets and evaluation benchmarks on GitHub.},

   abstract = {Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities for artificial intelligence applications in finance. In this paper, we provide a practical survey focused on two key aspects of utilizing LLMs for financial tasks: existing solutions and guidance for adoption. First, we review current approaches employing LLMs in finance, including leveraging pretrained models via zero-shot or few-shot learning, fine-tuning on domain-specific data, and training custom LLMs from scratch. We summarize key models and evaluate their performance improvements on financial natural language processing tasks. Second, we propose a decision framework to guide financial professionals in selecting the appropriate LLM solution based on their use case constraints around data, compute, and performance needs. The framework provides a pathway from lightweight experimentation to heavy investment in customized LLMs. Lastly, we discuss limitations and challenges around leveraging LLMs in financial applications. Overall, this survey aims to synthesize the state-of-the-art and provide a roadmap for responsibly applying LLMs to advance financial AI.},

   abstract = {In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have seen considerable advancements and have been applied in diverse fields. Built on the Transformer architecture, these models are trained on extensive datasets, enabling them to understand and generate human language effectively. In the financial domain, the deployment of LLMs is gaining momentum. These models are being utilized for automating financial report generation, forecasting market trends, analyzing investor sentiment, and offering personalized financial advice. Leveraging their natural language processing capabilities, LLMs can distill key insights from vast financial data, aiding institutions in making informed investment choices and enhancing both operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. In this study, we provide a comprehensive overview of the emerging integration of LLMs into various financial tasks. Additionally, we conducted holistic tests on multiple financial tasks through the combination of natural language instructions. Our findings show that GPT-4 effectively follow prompt instructions across various financial tasks. This survey and evaluation of LLMs in the financial domain aim to deepen the understanding of LLMs' current role in finance for both financial practitioners and LLM researchers, identify new research and application prospects, and highlight how these technologies can be leveraged to solve practical challenges in the finance industry.},
